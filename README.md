Final Project John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt

Team Members: Origin Slakman (solo project)

Changes
-------
Major Modification: Added the countdown timer feature plus its respective UI. When timer reaches zero, player autiomatically gets caught, resulting in a game over/restart. Also, made the timer look nice

Minor Modification: Speed Boost. Wasn't sure if this is what was meant to be implemented, since the name sounds like a powerup, but the descxription just says a button press. Implemented it similar to a sprint button feature
